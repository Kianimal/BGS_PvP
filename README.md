# BGS_PvP
A simple PvP toggle for your RedM VORP server

This PvP toggle will disable the E and F melee keybindings, preventing the player from attacking any player or NPC with these keys.

Good for preventing accidental/unintentional chokeholds and face punches.

Works via a (configurable) command.
